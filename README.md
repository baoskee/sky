# Sky Text Editor

A text editor written in the Skew programming language. It uses the 2D canvas API to render text and implements selection, high-DPI rendering, scrollbars, keyboard shortcuts, clipboard support, syntax highlighting, and multiple cursors. Because it's written in Skew, the generated JavaScript is extremely compact (23kb at the time of writing). This is a toy project and is not intended for real use.
